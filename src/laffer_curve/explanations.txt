The Laffer Curve is a hypothesis formulated by economist Arthur Laffer in 1974.

Arthur Laffer (1940- ) is a liberal American economist. He is a proponent of "supply-side economics," a school of thought that argues stimulating growth requires supporting supply, and therefore businesses. He notably inspired Reagan's economic policies, which led to a significant reduction in taxes.

Thus, Arthur Laffer defends the adage "too much tax kills tax." According to Laffer's theory, an increase in taxes contributes to the growth of state revenues up to a certain threshold. Once this threshold is passed, increasing taxes leads to a decrease in fiscal revenues. However, Laffer never defined this threshold, i.e., the tax rate that maximizes state revenues.

Through this theory, Laffer justifies tax reduction policies, advocating for a relatively low tax rate.

#### Why "too much tax kills tax"?
A too high level of taxation would lead to an economic slowdown by discouraging households from working.

According to Laffer, there would be two effects of reducing income taxes:
1. **Immediate effect**: The reduction in taxes leads to an equivalent decrease in state revenues.
2. **Long-term effect**: The money not spent on paying taxes will be spent elsewhere. Demand would increase, which would be beneficial for economic growth.

Thus, two opposing effects would occur:
- **Income effect**: Increasing taxes would push workers to work more.
- **Substitution effect**: Households would not seek to work more (due to the reduced income from additional work) and might decide to turn to leisure instead.
  
How to know which effect dominates?

Many economists reject Laffer's theory, finding it too simplistic. Empirical studies show the model's excessive simplicity.
